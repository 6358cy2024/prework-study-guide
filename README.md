## Usage

This page demonstrates each of the functionalities of the different aspects of HTML, CSS, and JS. HTML is the structure of the page and shows os the different headings and sections in the page. Then the CSS allows us to add more details to the page. I also familiarized myself with git to create different branches on my project and then later merged them together on GitHub. Lastly I was able to access the console on the HTML page and watch JS work in front of me.
